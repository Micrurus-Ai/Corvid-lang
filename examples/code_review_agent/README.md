# Code Review Agent

Code review agent that reads a pull request diff, asks a structured review
prompt for a checklist-backed finding, and keeps GitHub comment posting behind
an explicit approval.

## Setup

From this directory:

```sh
set CORVID_TEST_MOCK_TOOLS={"fetch_pull_request_diff":{"repo":"Micrurus-Ai/Corvid-lang","number":418,"base_sha":"base_redacted_20260504","head_sha":"head_redacted_20260504","diff":"approval bypass diff"}}
set CORVID_TEST_MOCK_LLM=1
set CORVID_TEST_MOCK_LLM_REPLIES={"draft_review_comment":{"path":"examples/refund_bot/src/main.cor","line":43,"severity":"high","checklist_id":"approval-boundary","body":"shortcut_refund calls issue_refund without an approval boundary; require approve IssueRefund before the tool call."}}
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- build
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- run
```

On macOS or Linux, use `export` instead of `set`.

Expected output includes:

```text
ReviewSession(... finding_count: 1 ... checklist_id: "approval-boundary" ... posted: false ...)
```

## What It Shows

- `fetch_pull_request_diff` and `post_review_comment` model the GitHub
  connector boundary with one typed surface.
- `draft_review_comment` returns a structured `ReviewComment`, not free-form
  prose that downstream code has to parse.
- The prompt tells the model that diff contents are untrusted input, and the
  unit test covers an injected diff instruction.
- `post_review_comment` is dangerous and cannot be called without
  `approve PostReviewComment(...)`.
- Replay covers the full read plus structured-review path deterministically.
- The hardening docs under `docs/` spell out real-provider opt-in, the
  app-specific security model, and the operator runbook.

## Verify

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- test examples/code_review_agent/tests/unit.cor
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- test examples/code_review_agent/tests/integration.cor
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- test examples/code_review_agent/tests/replay_invariant.cor
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- eval examples/code_review_agent/evals/code_review_agent.cor
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- replay examples/code_review_agent/traces/code_review_agent_review_session.jsonl
cargo run -q -p corvid-cli -- replay examples/code_review_agent/seed/traces/code_review_agent_review_session.jsonl
```

Set the mock env vars from the setup section before running tests or evals.
Replay does not need mock env vars because it substitutes the committed trace
responses. The adversarial fixtures under `tests/adversarial/` are checked by
`cargo test -p corvid-cli --test demo_project_defaults`.

## How To Modify

Add new review scenarios under `seed/`, update the mock tool and LLM queues,
then update tests, eval assertions, and replay fixtures together. Keep any
GitHub write behind an explicit `approve` statement and add a compiler
rejection test for the unapproved variant.
