# Corvid Effect System Specification

This directory is the normative specification of Corvid's dimensional effect system — the AI-native safety type system that has no precedent in any other language.

**Status.** Living document. Phase 20g scope. Every code example in this spec is a runnable Corvid program that is compiled and executed during spec publication; if an example breaks, the spec fails CI.

## Table of contents

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| [00 — Overview and motivation](./00-overview.md) | What the effect system is, why Corvid has one, how it differs from prior art |
| [01 — Dimensional syntax](./01-dimensional-syntax.md) | `effect` declarations, `uses` clauses, `@constraint(...)` annotations, custom dimensions via `corvid.toml`, proof-carrying dimensions, spec↔compiler sync, cross-language counter-proofs |
| [02 — Composition algebra](./02-composition-algebra.md) | Five composition archetypes, derivation from first principles, counter-design demonstrations, category-theoretic framing, effect-diff tooling, community dimension registry, self-verifying verification |

| [04 — Built-in dimensions](./04-builtin-dimensions.md) | Cost, trust, reversible, data, latency, confidence + tokens/latency_ms helpers — each with physical meaning, composition rule, constraint form, worked example, counter-design, attack-surface review |
| [05 — Grounding and provenance](./05-grounding.md) | `Grounded<T>`, data-flow verification, `cites ctx strictly` |

| [13 — Typed model substrate: what shipped](./13-model-substrate-shipped.md) | Phase 20h compiler track — `model` decls, `requires:` capability, `route:`, `progressive:`, `rollout`, jurisdiction/compliance/privacy dims. Real compiling examples, implementation references, shipping trail. |
| [14 — Replay, prod-as-test-suite, and behavior-diff: what shipped](./14-replay.md) | Phase 21 thesis — every run writes a trace; prod traces are the regression suite; PRs carry a signed behavior receipt. `@replayable` / `@deterministic`, the `replay` language primitive, `corvid test --from-traces` + `--promote`, `corvid trace-diff`, shadow daemon, determinism axes. |
| [counterexamples/](./counterexamples/) | Every historical bypass attempt as a permanent regression test |
| [bounty.md](./bounty.md) | Public submission process for effect-system bypasses and false positives |
| [dimension-artifacts.md](./dimension-artifacts.md) | Signed custom-dimension artifact format: declaration, proof, and regression corpus |

## How to read this spec

1. **If you want the 5-minute pitch**: read [00-overview.md](./00-overview.md).
2. **If you want the language-level primer**: read 01 → 02 → 04.
3. **If you want to understand a specific invention**: jump to 05–09.
4. **If you're comparing against another language**: read 11.
5. **If you want to attack the type system**: read 12, then the counterexamples directory.

## How to verify this spec

Every numbered section contains runnable examples. To verify:

```
cargo run -p corvid-cli -- test spec
```

This compiles every code block in every `.md` file in this directory against the current Corvid toolchain. Broken examples fail CI.

## Toolchain commands introduced by this spec

The effect system ships with a set of CLI commands that make the dimensional algebra operable from the command line:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `corvid test dimensions` | Run algebraic-law proptest suites on every custom dimension declared in `corvid.toml` |
| `corvid test spec` | Re-compile every `.cor` example block in this directory against the current toolchain |
| `corvid test spec --site-out <DIR>` | Render this executable spec as static HTML with Run-in-REPL buttons for every Corvid fence |
| `corvid test spec --meta` | Run meta-verification: mutate the verifier, confirm each counter-example is caught |
| `corvid test rewrites` | Run preserved-semantics rewrite verification; drift reports name the rewrite rule and law |
| `corvid test adversarial` | Run the LLM-driven bypass generator against the effect checker |
| `corvid effect-diff <before> <after>` | Diff the composed effect profile between two revisions and report constraint firings |
| `corvid add-dimension <name>@<version> [--registry <index>]` | Install a signed dimension from the Corvid effect registry, verify hash/signature/laws/proofs/regressions |
| `corvid add-dimension ./dimension.dim.toml` | Install a local custom dimension or signed dimension artifact after law/proof/regression verification |

See [01-dimensional-syntax.md](./01-dimensional-syntax.md) §5 and [02-composition-algebra.md](./02-composition-algebra.md) §9–§11 for how each command fits into the dimensional model.

## Correctness guarantees

The Corvid compiler's effect system ships with five verification techniques running on every CI build:

1. **Cross-tier differential verification.** The same program's effect profile is computed by four tiers (type checker, interpreter, native codegen, replay) and they must all agree. Any divergence fails the build.
2. **Adversarial LLM-driven bypass generation.** An LLM generates programs designed to bypass the effect checker. The compiler must reject every one.
3. **Preserved-semantics fuzzing.** Programs are randomly rewritten in ways that should preserve the effect profile. If the profile changes, the analyzer is non-compositional.
4. **Mutation testing.** Known-correct programs are systematically mutated. Every mutation must be caught by the compiler.
5. **Regression corpus.** Every historical bypass attempt, including community-submitted bounties, is permanently tested. New releases cannot regress old catches.

Details of each in [12-verification.md](./12-verification.md).

## Contributing

If you find a program that should be rejected but compiles clean — or accepted but is rejected incorrectly — use the [effect-system bounty process](./bounty.md). Accepted bypasses are credited to the reporter and added to [counterexamples/](./counterexamples/) as a permanent regression test.
