//! Cross-file module resolution for Corvid `.cor` imports.
//!
//! When a source file contains `import "./path" as alias`, downstream
//! passes need to be able to look up `alias.Name` in the imported
//! file's exported symbol table. This module defines the shared
//! structures that carry that information across the resolver + type
//! checker boundary.
//!
//! The loader itself — which file-system walking + parsing happens
//! when — lives outside this crate so that `corvid-resolve` does not
//! depend on `corvid-syntax`. The driver populates the structures
//! here; the checker consumes them.
//!
//! The design deliberately separates three passes:
//!
//! 1. **Collect** — BFS from the root file, gather every reachable
//!    import path. Cycle detection runs here.
//! 2. **Resolve** — for each collected file, call `resolve(&file)`
//!    to produce a `Resolved`. This is the existing per-file pass,
//!    unchanged.
//! 3. **Package** — build a [`ModuleResolution`] by pairing each
//!    alias in the root's imports with its resolved module +
//!    public-export table.
//!
//! The checker receives the root file's `Resolved` plus the
//! `ModuleResolution`. When it encounters `TypeRef::Qualified`, it
//! looks up the alias → module → export. Visibility is enforced at
//! export-collection time: private declarations simply don't appear
//! in [`ResolvedModule::exports`].
