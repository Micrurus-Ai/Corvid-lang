//! Public typed records for the guarantee registry — slice 35
//! / canonical contract surface, decomposed in Phase 20j-A8.
//!
//! Three enums + one struct exhaustively describe every public
//! Corvid guarantee:
//!
//! - [`GuaranteeKind`] — the moat dimension (approval, effect
//!   row, grounded, budget, confidence, replay, provenance, ABI,
//!   server, jobs, auth, connector, observability, platform).
//! - [`GuaranteeClass`] — `Static` / `RuntimeChecked` /
//!   `OutOfScope`. Drives the registry's honesty rules.
//! - [`Phase`] — pipeline lane that owns enforcement (Resolve,
//!   TypeCheck, IrLower, Codegen, Sign, Runtime, Platform).
//! - [`Guarantee`] — the row itself: id + kind + class + phase +
//!   description + out_of_scope_reason + per-row test refs.
