//! The signed-cdylib claim whitelist — slice 35-J / signed
//! attestation surface, decomposed in Phase 20j-A8.
//!
//! Every guarantee id in [`SIGNED_CDYLIB_CLAIM_GUARANTEE_IDS`]
//! is asserted by the build's DSSE-signed ABI descriptor for
//! every signed cdylib artifact. The build signing gate
//! (`corvid build --sign`) refuses to emit a signature unless
//! every declared contract in the source maps to a registry
//! entry whose id is in this list — so the signed binary
//! advertises only enforced claims, never aspirational ones.
//!
//! Excluded from the list:
//! - guarantees whose subject is not a cdylib (e.g.,
//!   receipt-envelope verification, observability sink shape)
//! - explicit non-defenses (the `OutOfScope` rows in
//!   [`super::registry::GUARANTEE_REGISTRY`])
